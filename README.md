## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

I learnt how to use CSS flex while working on this challenge.

```html
<section class="flex justify-center text-white">
    <div class="w-50 text-center">
      <div>
        <img src="images/illustration-intro.png" alt="intro svg">
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 class="mt-4">All your files in one secure location, accessible anywhere.</h2>
        <div class="mt-4">Fylo stores all your most important files in one secure location. Access them wherever
          you need, share and collaborate with friends family, and co-workers.
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
          <button class="get-started">Get Started</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  position: absolute;
    right: 5.8%;
    margin-top: 3.5rem;
}
```

### Continued development
I Really Look Forward To Learning
